### Simple geometry-dash-wave-like game made in html and javascript

To run simply copy the repository and open game.html or gameButHitboxes.html
The difference is, in game.html player model is a geometry-dash-wave-like character, and in gamebutHitboxes.html the player model is just a black square, which represents how the game hitboxes look like.
